Excellent — this is the **right mindset** if you want acceptance.
Below is a **STRICT, NON-NEGOTIABLE RULEBOOK** for writing an **IEEE conference research paper** (AI-based churn prediction or similar).
If you violate these, **rejection probability becomes very high**.

---

# 🚨 STRICT RULES FOR AN IEEE-ACCEPTABLE RESEARCH PAPER

*(Follow ALL of these — not optional)*

---

## 🔴 RULE 1: CLEAR PROBLEM STATEMENT (MANDATORY)

❌ Rejection if missing.

You **MUST clearly answer** in the **Introduction**:

* What exact problem are you solving?
* Why is this problem important?
* Why current solutions are insufficient?

### Example (required style):

> Customer churn leads to significant revenue loss in subscription-based industries. Existing machine learning approaches often struggle with class imbalance and feature complexity, motivating the need for an AI-based predictive framework.

📌 **If a reviewer cannot identify the problem in 30 seconds → REJECT**

---

## 🔴 RULE 2: STRONG LITERATURE REVIEW (NO WEAK RELATED WORK)

❌ 3–4 references = instant red flag.

You **MUST**:

* Cite **at least 10–15 papers**
* Compare methods, not just list them
* Mention **limitations** of previous work

### REQUIRED structure:

> Author → Method → Dataset → Result → Limitation

📌 **No comparison = looks like beginner work → REJECT**

---

## 🔴 RULE 3: CLEAR NOVELTY CLAIM (MOST CRITICAL)

❌ No novelty = automatic rejection.

You **MUST explicitly say**:

* What is NEW in your work
* How it differs from existing methods

### Allowed novelty types:

* New feature engineering approach
* Hybrid / ensemble model
* Improved preprocessing
* Better performance on same dataset
* Reduced complexity / training time

### REQUIRED sentence:

> *The main contribution of this paper is…*

📌 **Never assume reviewers will guess your novelty**

---

## 🔴 RULE 4: PROPER DATASET DESCRIPTION (MANDATORY)

❌ Missing dataset details = REJECT.

You **MUST mention**:

* Dataset source
* Number of samples
* Number of features
* Class distribution
* Preprocessing steps

Example:

> The dataset contains 7,043 customers with 21 attributes, including demographic and usage-based features.

---

## 🔴 RULE 5: REPRODUCIBLE METHODOLOGY

❌ Vague methodology = REJECT.

You **MUST explain**:

* Model architecture
* Hyperparameters
* Train-test split
* Validation technique
* Tools (Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)

📌 Reviewer must be able to **reproduce your results**

---

## 🔴 RULE 6: MULTIPLE EVALUATION METRICS (CRITICAL FOR AI)

❌ Accuracy only = BIG RED FLAG 🚩

You **MUST include**:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* ROC-AUC (recommended)

Especially for **churn (imbalanced data)**.

---

## 🔴 RULE 7: BASELINE COMPARISON (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ No comparison = REJECT.

You **MUST compare**:

* Your model vs existing models
* Traditional ML vs your AI approach

Example:

> The proposed model outperforms Random Forest and SVM in terms of F1-score and recall.

---

## 🔴 RULE 8: RESULT ANALYSIS (NOT JUST TABLES)

❌ Tables without explanation = weak paper.

You **MUST explain**:

* Why your model performed better
* What features contributed most
* Where it failed

📌 Reviewer wants **insight**, not numbers only.

---

## 🔴 RULE 9: IEEE FORMAT VIOLATION = DESK REJECT

❌ Wrong format = REJECT without review.

You **MUST**:

* Use official IEEE double-column template
* Correct margins
* Correct font sizes
* Proper figure captions
* Proper reference style

📌 Even good research gets rejected for formatting errors.

---

## 🔴 RULE 10: ETHICAL & ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

❌ Plagiarism > 20% = REJECT + BLACKLIST.

You **MUST**:

* Paraphrase everything
* Cite all borrowed ideas
* Keep similarity < 15%

---

## 🔴 RULE 11: STRONG ABSTRACT (VERY IMPORTANT)

❌ Weak abstract = REJECT early.

Your abstract **MUST include**:

1. Problem
2. Method
3. Dataset
4. Results
5. Contribution

---

## 🔴 RULE 12: FUTURE WORK (REQUIRED)

❌ Missing future work = weak research maturity.

You **MUST mention**:

* Limitations
* How work can be extended

---

## 🔴 RULE 13: RECENT REFERENCES (MANDATORY)

❌ No recent papers = outdated research.

You **MUST include**:

* At least **5 papers from last 4 years**

---

## 🔴 RULE 14: CONTRIBUTION BULLET POINTS (HIGH IMPACT)

You **SHOULD include**:

* 2–4 bullet points of contributions

This increases acceptance chances significantly.

---

## 🔴 RULE 15: CLEAR CONCLUSION (NO REPEATING)

❌ Copying abstract = lazy ending.

Conclusion **MUST**:

* Summarize findings
* Reinforce contribution
* Highlight performance improvement

---

# ✅ ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (PRINT THIS)

Before submission, confirm **YES** to all:

* [ ] Clear problem statement
* [ ] 15–20 quality references
* [ ] Explicit novelty
* [ ] Dataset fully described
* [ ] Reproducible methodology
* [ ] Multiple evaluation metrics
* [ ] Baseline comparison
* [ ] Results explained
* [ ] IEEE format followed
* [ ] Low plagiarism
* [ ] Strong abstract
* [ ] Future work included

If **ANY ONE is NO → Fix it first**

---

# 🏆 FINAL ADVICE (VERY IMPORTANT)

> **Reviewers don’t reject bad English — they reject unclear contribution.**

Follow these rules strictly, and your paper will:

* Look **professional**
* Pass desk review
* Have a **high probability of acceptance**

---

If you want, I can:

* Review your paper **section by section**
* Write a **perfect IEEE abstract**
* Help you **define novelty clearly**
* Suggest **reviewer-friendly wording**

Just tell me what section you’re writing next 💪
